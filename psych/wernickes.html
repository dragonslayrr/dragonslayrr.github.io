                <div class="bar1-1">Description:</div>
                <div class="bar1-2">The main characteristic of Wernicke's aphasia is impaired language comprehension. Despite having impaired comprehension someone with Wernicke's aphasia may still have normal rate, rythem, and grammar.</div>

                <div class="bar2-1">Causes:</div>
                <div class="bar2-2">Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by brain damage usually on the left side. This is often caused by a loss of blood flow due to a stroke. The most common way to get Wernicke’s aphasia is from an ischemic stroke which affects the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere.</div>

                <div class="bar3-1">Diagnosis:</div>
                <div class="bar3-2">Wernicke’s aphasia is typically diagnosed through brain imaging tests like MRI or CT scan. These brain imaging tests help the doctor determine what parts of the brain were damaged.</div>

                <div class="bar4-1">Symptoms:</div>
                <div class="bar4-2">Typical symptoms of Wernicke’s aphasia include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>stringing words together to form nonsense sentences</li>
                        <li>making up words</li>
                        <li>being unaware of mistakes in their speech</li>
                        <li>having difficulty repeating phrases</li>
                        <li>adding words when trying to repeat someone</li>
                        <li>interrupting others</li>
                        <li>speaking rapidly</li>
                    </ul>
                     Victims of Wernicke’s aphasia may also:
                    <ul>
                        <li>have a severely impared reading and writing ability</li>
                        <li>understand visual material better than written or spoken words</li>
                        <li>maintain cognitive abilities other than those associated with language</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="bar5-1">Who is affected:</div>
                <div class="bar5-2">Wernicke’s aphasia commonly affects those who have frequent strokes. This is because strokes impair the blood flow to the brain and when blood doesn't reach the wernicke's area is can kill brain cells, resulting in wernicke's aphasia. Aphasia affects 25 to 40 percent of people who experience strokes.</div>
                <div class="bar6-1">What is the outlook:</div>
                <div class="bar6-2">Some people who get wernicke's aphasia manage to recover on their own. Children under 8 can regain full language ability even after a severe case of wernicke's aphasia. For everyone else though wernicke’s aphasia has no standard treatment but can instead be cured or partly cured through speech therapy.</div>

                <div class="bar7-1">Treatment:</div>
                <div class="bar7-2">Wernicke's aphasia has no traditional treatment but someone who has wernicke’s aphasia can be cured through speach therapy. This recovery usually takes about 3 months but improvement may only be seen after a year. It is also common for the patient to never regain full language ability.</div>
