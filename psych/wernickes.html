                <div class="bar2-2">Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by brain damage usually on the left side. This is often caused by a loss of blood flow due to a stroke. The most common way to get Wernicke’s aphasia is from an ischemic stroke which affects the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere.</div>
