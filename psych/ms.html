                <div class="bar3-1">Diagnosis:</div>
                <div class="bar3-2">There is no specific way to diagnose Multiple Sclerosis so doctors have to rule out other conditions that can produce similar signs and symptoms. This process is known as a differential diagnosis. Some diagnoses that may be used to identify MS are blood tests, spinal taps, MRI’s, and evoked potential tests.</div>
                <div class="bar4-1">Symptoms:</div>
                <div class="bar4-2">Multiple Sclerosis has many symptoms, some more common than others. Some of these symptoms include, double Vision, fatigue, numbness and tingling, muscle spasms, stiffness, and weakness, mobility issues, generalized pain, bladder and bowel problems, difficulty swallowing and speaking, depression and anxiety, etc. Most people who have multiple sclerosis will only experience a few of these symptoms.</div>

                <div class="bar5-1">Who is affected:</div>
                <div class="bar5-2">Multiple Sclerosis can occur at any age but you are most likely to show signs around 20 and 40 years of age. Women are also 2-3 times as likely to have relapsing MS.</div>
                <div class="bar6-1">What is the outlook:</div>
                <div class="bar6-2">Multiple Sclerosis is rarely fatal but you can get serious complications from a severe case of MS. The average life expectancy for people with MS is around 5 to 10 years lower than average but this gap appears to keep getting smaller.</div>

                <div class="bar7-1">Treatment:</div>
                <div class="bar7-2">There is no cure to multiple sclerosis so the treatment focuses on allowing the patient to quickly recover from attacks, slowing the disease's progression, and managing the symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may not be necessary.</div>
